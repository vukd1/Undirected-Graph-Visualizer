<h1>JavaFX Undirected Graph Visualizer</h1>

A simple JavaFX application for visualizing and transforming undirected graphs.

Key features:
<ul>
  <li>An interactive UI for drawing graphs, manipulating vertices and edges, and assigning edge weights.</li>
  <li>Implementation of core graph algorithms, such as Kruskal’s algorithm, BFS, DFS, and the Union-Find data structure.</li>
</ul>

This app was originally built as a class assignment, but was later extended into a general-purpose tool to help students better understand
graph algorithms.
